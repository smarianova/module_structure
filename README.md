### Project Description
Machine Learning technology containing a file that can be imported as a library to see different applications of tensors.
### Installation
To be able to use the python file tensor_operations as a library firstly, you have to do pip install -U git+url of the repository, that you can find in the code button and copy the url. You have to do pip install in your environment. Also, you have to import pytorch library and numpy. Then, you can create a new python file and write from tensor_calc.tensor_operations import TensorCalculator and now you will have to create an instance of the class and use the functions.
### Functions
The python file tensor_operations contains a class with the following methods:
<ol>
  <li>tensor_zeros: parameters- dimensions x and y  return- a tensor with all zeros of the dimension specified. </li>
  <li>tensor_ones: parameters- dimensions x and y   return- a tensor with all ones of the dimension specified.</li>
  <li>tensor_random: parameters- dimensions x and y return- a tensor with random numbers of the dimension specified. </li>
  <li>tensor_sum: parameters- tensor1 and tensor2 return- a new tensor with the sum.</li>
  <li>tensor_mult: parameters- tensor1 and tensor2 return- a new tensor with the multiplication.</li>
  <li>tensor_transpose: parameters- a tensor return- transposed tensor.</li>
  <li>tensor_substraction: parameters-tensor1 and tensor2 return- new tensor with the substraction.</li>
  <li>tensor_equal: parameters- tensor 1 and tensor2 return- False/True depending if they are or not equal.</li>
  <li>tensor_pow: parameters- tensor1 and tensor2 return- tensor pow the second one.</li>
</ol>

### Technology used
Machine Learning technology specifically tensors in python programming language.
